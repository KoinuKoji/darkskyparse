Parses Dark Sky API for weather data

This is simply a tool that will allow users to retrieve up to 1000 pings from DarkSky (or more if you pay for it). Still very basic but hope it will be helpful to someone!

https://darksky.net/dev - Go here to sign up for a free API for DarkSky.

Currently, the line outputfile = open('weatherdata.csv','a', newline='') is set to append, but change 'a' to 'w' to create a new file.

Hope this helps someone else in need!
